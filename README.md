1. Real-time Client-Side Phishing Detection Chrome Extension
Project Description
This project involved the design, development, and evaluation of a Google Chrome Extension aimed at enhancing email security by detecting phishing attempts in real-time. Unlike traditional server-side solutions, this extension performs client-side analysis directly within the browser, ensuring immediate threat assessment and preserving user privacy by not transmitting sensitive data externally.

Key Features
Real-time Detection: Analyzes email content and Document Object Model (DOM) as it renders in the browser, providing immediate threat assessment.

Client-Side Machine Learning: Leverages lightweight machine learning models optimized for browser environments to detect phishing without external data transmission.

DOM Feature Extraction: Implements robust JavaScript routines to parse Gmail's web interface, extracting critical features such as sender details, subject, body text, links, and form elements.

User-Centric Alerting: Provides an intuitive and non-intrusive user interface to clearly communicate potential phishing risks and explanations for warnings.

Performance Optimization: Focuses on minimizing latency and impact on browser responsiveness, demonstrating the feasibility of in-browser ML for cybersecurity.

Technologies Used
Machine Learning (ML): Core of the detection logic, utilizing lightweight models.

JavaScript: For Chrome Extension development, DOM manipulation, and ML pipeline implementation within the browser.

Chrome Extension APIs: For integrating the solution seamlessly into the browser environment.
